BUGFIX: Toggling fullscreen (F11) in a disassembly view and back, could result in IDA not realizing that the number of displayed lines became smaller and make the cursor invisible.
BUGFIX: type information propagation from unnamed array function parameters would result in incorrectly named data
BUGFIX: ui/qt: &quot;Jump in new hex window&quot; wouldn't jump to the right address
BUGFIX: ui/qt: deleting a script snippet would mark the one that gets selected afterwards as 'modified'
BUGFIX: ui/qt: IDA could leave F11-style fullscreen while navigating around and/or performing other actions.
BUGFIX: ui/qt: If IDA encountered an error at startup, it might not have had time to create the taskbar icon yet, sometimes leaving that error/warning dialog hard to reach.
BUGFIX: ui/qt: on Windows or OSX when a screen reader is used (e.g., JAWS or VoiceOver), the IDA View-A will automatically switch to flat listing since graph views are not accessible
BUGFIX: ui/qt: Using special mouse buttons 4 & 5 to move forward & backward in history, would change the cursor coordinates
BUGFIX: UI: IDA could lose the preferences for synchronization between views (and possibly registers, in case of debugging.)
BUGFIX: UI: On Windows, the &quot;Load a new file&quot; dialog wouldn't create a taskbar entry, meaning it could be hard to find it on the desktop if another window showed up in front
BUGFIX: UI: re-enabled building graph of code and data xrefs to current address
BUGFIX: UI: Renaming an unsaved script snippet could lose its contents
BUGFIX: UI: The 'Default CLI' wouldn't be applied if IDA opened w/o a database.
BUGFIX: ui: the &quot;Functions window&quot; could spend too much time refreshing the list of function names, even when no functions were modified
BUGFIX: UI: the &quot;Segment registers&quot; view had fixed minimum size, meaning it was impossible to resize other tabs in case it was opened in a tabbed view.
BUGFIX: Using enums (or names) in IDC snippets could lead to a compilation error, while it would work if the same code was run from an .idc file.
BUGFIX: Using the &quot;Shortcuts&quot; editor to save a shortcut such as '\', will cause IDA to complain at next startup
BUGFIX: decompiler: a pair of push/pop instructions could be annihilated even if there was a direct access (e.g. via 'mov [sp], ...' instruction) to the corresponding stack slot
BUGFIX: decompiler: a truncating cast of argument of abs() could be erroneously deleted
BUGFIX: decompiler: arm: fixed interr 50766
BUGFIX: decompiler: arm: incorrect translation of instructions sxtb, sxth, sxtab, sxtah, sxtw, uxtw, uxtb, uxth, uxtab, uxtah (wrong operand size)
BUGFIX: decompiler: changing of a global variable type did not initiate re-decompilation of some functions depending on the type
BUGFIX: decompiler: combining low/high ldx instructions could lead to wrong microcode in some cases for big endian processors
BUGFIX: decompiler: could display &data instead of plain integer in some cases
BUGFIX: decompiler: decompiler could fail with interr 51483 on corrupted idbs
BUGFIX: decompiler: division by zero could be erroneously produced in some cases
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed incorrect printing of low part of 128bit value when high part is not zero
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50873
BUGFIX: decompiler: fix interr 50766 in case of bad switch information (conver it to a non-fatal error message)
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50288
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50348
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50498
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50498
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50586
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50707
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50710
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50778
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50815
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50831
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50836
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50836 (hexppc)
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50854
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50854
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50873
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 50920
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 51091
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 51292
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interr 51549
BUGFIX: decompiler: fixed interrs 50831, 50836
BUGFIX: decompiler: in 64-bit mode, all segment registers except fs/gs always map to zero
BUGFIX: decompiler: in some cases 64bit addition rule could produce incorrect results
BUGFIX: decompiler: in some cases 64bit multiplication by 2 could be transformed into incorrect expression
BUGFIX: decompiler: in some cases decompiler could produce pointer subtract expressions with swapped operands (y-x instead of x-y)
BUGFIX: decompiler: in some cases magic 'mod' operation could be recognized incorrectly (truncated constant divisor)
BUGFIX: decompiler: in some cases x86 FPU registers could be handled incorrectly
BUGFIX: decompiler: necessary casts to int128 would be missing from the output
BUGFIX: decompiler: patching a function byte would not mark the function as requiring a new decompilation output
BUGFIX: decompiler: ppc: 'bclrl' used for indirect calls would not be decompiled
BUGFIX: decompiler: removed incorrect optimization rule (low == 0 || high == 0) --&gt; (full == 0)
BUGFIX: decompiler: some registers were incorrectly translated into scattered arglocs on Big Endian platforms
BUGFIX: decompiler: swapped arguments for intrinsic 'atan2', fixed target for intrinsics '__FPREM__', '__FPREM1__'
BUGFIX: decompiler: the conversion of the floating constant from the bits should ignore the endianness, it was accounted already
BUGFIX: decompiler: try sign-extended value if zero-extended value does not correspond to any enum member but the user asked to use the enum
BUGFIX: decompiler: use/def chains could not calculated incorrectly in some rare cases
BUGFIX: decompiler:hexppc: fixed the decoding of the se_btsti (VLE) insn
BUGFIX: version info in idaq for windows was stored incorrectly
BUGFIX: when debugging, toggling breakpoints could become impossible if the last closed widget was a hex view or stack view.
BUGFIX: When evaluating low-level conditions, the debugger module could fail reporting some events
BUGFIX: When no enumerations were present in the &quot;Enums&quot; view, pressing 'PageDown' would result in the comment being duplicated.
BUGFIX: windbg: some registers (typically ST0) could lose their value after stepping
BUGFIX: WinDbg: when run under text IDA (idaw.exe), console processes could share the same stdout as idaw.exe itself, causing a possible deadlock any time a debug event happens
BUGFIX:ui: OSX: idaq64 would always launch idaq if a file was dragged onto the dock icon
